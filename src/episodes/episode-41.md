description: "In this episode of therapy we get back to basics.  In my office with me today is Dr. Theodore H. Cockstain, from the University of Witchery and Dark Farts.  His goat like ability to problem solve and translate, all while being on the sober team, is majestic to behold. 
              Recent Doctorate,  Mrs. Nawt Special Kaay, introduces us to her unique style of therapy.   Known for it's ease of use, this strategy can get you into any game!  We also discuss how she hasn't found a better man."
